Readme for 'staTeX' package.

This package is aimed at facilitating the printing of statistical results in Sweave, reducing several lines of code to \Sexpr{st(object)} where the st function automatically extracts statistical results, formats it and returns it in proper LaTeX code.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I am especially looking for more st methods to extract results. The code should be in the format:

st.class <- function(x,...)
{
  # extract information from x...
  
  pval(name statistic, value statistic, p value, degrees of freedom, ...)
}

Multiple statistical results from one object (e.g. anova) should be returned in a named vector.
