Readme for 'swst' package.

This package is aimed at facilitating the printing of statistical results in Sweave, reducing several lines of code to \Sexpr{swst(object)} where the swst function automatically extracts statistical results, formats it and returns it in proper LaTeX code.

Any help is greatly appreciated and I'll be happy to add you to the authors list if requested if you do so. I am especially looking for more swst methods to extract results. The code should be in the format:

swst.class <- function(x,...)
{
  # extract information from x...
  
  swp(name statistic, value statistic, p value, degrees of freedom, ...)
}

Multiple statistical results from one object (e.g. anova) should be returned in a named vector.
